    "text": "Movement Trends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the time series above, movement tends to be highest in the summer (June, July, August), gradually decrease during autumn (September, October, November) and winter (December, January, February) and experience a sharp increase in the late spring (May). Perhaps this increase is timed with parturition, which has been found to start in April/May (Adamczewski 1997). Alternatively, this could be tied to the timing of snowmelt. We can explore this further by looking at average seasonal step lengths for each muskox:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep lengths in the winter and spring are similar, whereas autumn step lengths are intermediate between winter and summer. This again highlights the discrepancy between the gradual decrease in step lengths from summer to winter compared with the sharper increase from winter to summer.\nFor the most part, average seasonal step lengths are consistent between muskoxen, though there appear to be greater variation in the spring and autumn. To examine this further, let’s plot smoothed curves of step lengths against day of year for different years. We’ll restrict this plot to muskoxen-year combinations with more than half a year’s worth of data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe curves of step lengths follow similar trajectories but there is still considerable variation across years and among muskoxen. This suggests weather, landscape, and muskox characteristics may play a part in influencing movement behaviour.",

See Bunnefeld et al. (2011) for examples of how these curves look for different movement classes (i.e. migrant, disperser, resident, nomad).\nTo do this we will use the adehabitatLT package to format our data and the migrateR package to fit different models to the net displacement data.

There does not appear to be a clear movement behaviour shared between all muskoxen. Most appear to have short periods of time during the summer with large net squared displacement, but these are generally followed by longer periods where net squared displacement is much smaller. Muskoxen 7011 and 7012 show a general increasing trend in net squared displacement, but there are still extended periods of smaller displacement throughout the time series. Most of the periods of larger displacement do not appear to be long enough to represent a separate summer range. Examinations of animations of muskox movements generally show that they tend to move between patches of resources during the summer rather than sticking to one specific area.",

The SDLfilter package has two functions, dupfilter and ddfilter, that remove data duplicates and unlikely points, respectively.\nFirst let’s use dupfilter to remove duplicate data points with the same date and time.\n\nsdl_dup &lt;- SDLfilter::dupfilter(sdl_musk, \n                                step.time = 7,\n                                conditional = TRUE)\n\n\ndupfilter_exact removed 3 of 14065 locations\ndupfilter_qi removed 0 of 14062 locations\ndupfilter_time removed 31 of 14062 locations\ndupfilter_space removed 0 of 14031 locations\n\nInput data: 14065 locations\nFiltered data: 14031 locations\ndupfilter removed 34 locations (0.24% of original data)\n\n\nNext we’ll use ddfilter to filter points based on speed and turning angles between consecutive points. To use this function, we need to estimate the maximum reasonable speed between two consecutive locations. The vmax function maps a gamma distribution to the observed speeds and estimates the maximum speed as the value with a cumulative probability of 0.999.\n\nvmax &lt;- SDLfilter::vmax(sdl_dup, prob = 0.999)\n\n\ndupfilter_exact removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_qi removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_time removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_space removed 176 of 14031 locations\n\nInput data: 14031 locations\nFiltered data: 13855 locations\ndupfilter removed 176 locations (1.25% of original data)\n\n\nThe maximum linear speed (Vmax) was estimated using 13841 locations.\nVmax: 0.4891431 km/h\n\n\nWe will also estimate the maximum one-way linear speed of a loop trip. A loop trip is defined as a spatial departure and return involving a series of three or more consecutive points. The vmaxlp function also uses a gamma distribution to estimate this speed:\n\nvmaxlp &lt;- SDLfilter::vmaxlp(sdl_dup, prob = 0.999)\n\n\ndupfilter_exact removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_qi removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_time removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_space removed 176 of 14031 locations\n\nInput data: 14031 locations\nFiltered data: 13855 locations\ndupfilter removed 176 locations (1.25% of original data)\n\n\nThe maximum one-way linear speed of a loop trip (vmaxlp) was estimated using \n180 Vlp from 90 loop trips.\nvmaxlp: 0.269 km/h\n\n\nNow we can filter our data using ddfilter. Locations are removed if one of following criteria are met: 1) speed from previous and to subsequent location both exceed vmax; 2) inner angle is less than a given threshold and speed from a previous or to a subsequent location exceeds vmaxlp. We will specify a turning angle of 14 degrees, as outlined in Bjørneraas et al. 2010.\n\nsdl_dd1 &lt;- SDLfilter::ddfilter(sdl_dup, qi = 5, \n                              vmax = vmax, vmaxlp = vmaxlp,\n                              ia = 14)\n\n\nddfilter_speed removed 39 of 14031 locations\nddfilter_loop removed 38 of 13992 locations\n\nInput data: 14031 locations\nFiltered data: 13954 locations\nddfilter removed 77 locations (0.55% of original data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe filtered points appear non-randomly across the time series, which suggests that our speed thresholds were too small. Let’s increase vmax and vmaxlp to more conservative values of 2 km/h and 1 km/h, respectively.\n\nsdl_dd2 &lt;- SDLfilter::ddfilter(sdl_dup, qi = 5, \n                              vmax = 2, vmaxlp = 1,\n                              ia = 14)\n\n\nddfilter_speed removed 1 of 14031 locations\nddfilter_loop removed 1 of 14030 locations\n\nInput data: 14031 locations\nFiltered data: 14029 locations\nddfilter removed 2 locations (0.01% of original data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat seems to do a better job of only removing the most extreme points.",

    "text": "Estimating Movement Model\nBefore we can estimate home ranges for the collared muskoxen, we need to determine an appropriate movement model. To do this, we will use variograms. Our data has been updated to conform to Movebank naming conventions so that we can use the ctmm package.\n\nlibrary(ctmm)\nmusk_move &lt;- read.csv(here(\"data/raw/muskox_data/musk_collar_filt_movebank.csv\"))\nmusk_tel &lt;- as.telemetry(musk_move)[c(-2,-4,-5)]\n\nFirst we will plot empirical variograms for each collared muskoxen. Variograms are used to quantify spatial dependence between locations at different points in time. In general, as the time between locations increases, spatial dependence decreases. Variograms plot the semi-variance of distances between pairs of points separated by different time lags. At short time lags, these distances are very similar and the semi-variance is low. At large time lags, there is greater variability in the distances between points, so the semi-variance is high. Usually variograms will reach an asymptote in semi-variance that represents the time lag at which the animal is able to traverse their home range. For now we will leave out the muskoxen that had collar failures as they do not have enough data to estimate home ranges.\n\nmusk_var &lt;- lapply(musk_tel, variogram, CI=\"Gauss\", fast = TRUE)\nxlim &lt;- c(0,5 %#% \"day\")\n\n\nmap(musk_var, function(x) x %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% mutate(id = x@info$identity)) %&gt;% \n  list_rbind() %&gt;%\n  mutate(level = 0.95,\n         ci.lower = SVF*qchisq((1-level)/2,DOF,lower.tail=TRUE)/DOF,\n         ci.upper = SVF*qchisq((1-level)/2,DOF,lower.tail=FALSE)/DOF) %&gt;%\n  group_by(id) %&gt;%\n  slice(seq(0.5*n())) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = lag, y = SVF)) +\n  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = ci.lower, ymax = ci.upper), colour = \"grey\") +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~id, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of these look fine, however for two of the longer time series (7011 and 7012) the semi-variance appears to reach an asymptote by the first year, but starts increasing again part way through the second year. If this behaviour is common, home range estimates may be biased even after a year’s worth of data. If muskoxen truly are nomadic and lack site fidelty, kernel density methods may not be appropriate (Silva et al., 2022).\nIt is also clear there are some issues with collars 708 and 7010. Closer inspection of the data reveals that, every 7 fixes, there is a longer 24 hour delay until the next fix. Currently, the model uses the median sampling interval (8 hours) to estimate the variogram. The variogram function allows is to specify more than one time interval (in our case, 8 and 24 hours) to progressively coarsen the variogram. We can also specify an interval-weighted algorithm to further improve the appearance of the variogram.\n\ndt &lt;- c(8,24) %#% \"hour\"\nmusk_var[[2]] &lt;- variogram(musk_tel[[2]], dt = dt, CI=\"Gauss\", fast = FALSE)\nmusk_var[[3]] &lt;- variogram(musk_tel[[3]], dt = dt, CI=\"Gauss\", fast = FALSE)\n\n\nmap(musk_var, function(x) x %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% mutate(id = x@info$identity)) %&gt;% \n  list_rbind() %&gt;%\n  mutate(level = 0.95,\n         ci.lower = SVF*qchisq((1-level)/2,DOF,lower.tail=TRUE)/DOF,\n         ci.upper = SVF*qchisq((1-level)/2,DOF,lower.tail=FALSE)/DOF)  %&gt;%\n  group_by(id) %&gt;%\n  slice(seq(0.5*n())) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = lag, y = SVF)) +\n  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = ci.lower, ymax = ci.upper), colour = \"grey\") +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~id, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese look better. Collars 7011 and 7012 do not appear to reach an asymptote in semi-variance as lag increases, suggesting that these individuals are not range resident. 7010 has a somewhat bell-shaped curve. This can be indicative of distinct winter and summer grounds. However, given that muskoxen appear to have limited movement in the winter and the ~1-year time series for 7010 starts and ends in winter, it seems more likely that the wintering grounds from one year to the next happened to be close together.\nWe can diagnose these issues further by fitting a variety of custom variogram functions to our data using the ctmm.select function.\n\n### fist create a best guess set of parameters for the model\nmusk_var_mod &lt;- lapply(musk_var, variogram.fit, interactive = FALSE)\n#fit &lt;- mapply(function(x,y){ctmm.select(x,y,verbose = TRUE,cores = 3)},musk_tel,musk_var_mod)\n#saveRDS(fit, here(\"output/musk_var_fit.rds\"))\nfit &lt;- readRDS(here(\"output/musk_var_fit.rds\"))\nfor (i in 1:length(musk_var)){print(musk_var[[i]]@info$identity);print(summary(fit[,i])); plot(musk_var[[i]], CTMM = fit[,i], col.CTMM=c(\"red\",\"purple\",\"blue\", \"green\"),fraction=0.5,level=0.5);plot(musk_var[[i]], CTMM = fit[,i], col.CTMM=c(\"red\",\"purple\",\"blue\", \"green\"),xlim = xlim,,level=0.5)}\n\n[1] \"706\"\n                     ΔAICc ΔRMSPE (km)  DOF[area]\nOUF anisotropic    0.00000    2.077907   9.617055\nOUF               42.66530    1.890928   9.990823\nOU anisotropic    68.82166    2.245986   7.367132\nOUf anisotropic 1317.33573    0.000000 219.589031\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"708\"\n                    ΔAICc ΔRMSPE (km) DOF[area]\nOUF anisotropic    0.0000    1.244331  25.89534\nOUF              116.7679    1.350865  18.22964\nOU anisotropic   198.9542    1.852910  21.97129\nOUf anisotropic 1030.2342    0.000000 285.96732\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"7010\"\n                    ΔAICc ΔRMSPE (km)  DOF[area]\nOUF anisotropic   0.00000    3.760725   8.090865\nOUF              57.73839    3.915642   8.109727\nOU anisotropic  149.18384    4.605075   4.914131\nOUf anisotropic 442.22301    0.000000 113.628816\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"7011\"\n                    ΔAICc ΔRMSPE (km)  DOF[area]\nOUF anisotropic    0.0000    5.483670   8.988154\nOUF              352.6867    6.712407   5.586937\nOU anisotropic   468.8016    6.491142   8.365915\nOUf anisotropic 2604.0344    0.000000 336.211689\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"7012\"\n                    ΔAICc ΔRMSPE (km)  DOF[area]\nOUF anisotropic    0.0000    3.607974  12.453842\nOUF              136.5556    4.887839  10.391674\nOU anisotropic   296.2989    4.133481   8.086789\nOUf anisotropic 2682.6031    0.000000 368.948403\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"7013\"\n                    ΔAICc ΔRMSPE (km)  DOF[area]\nOUF anisotropic    0.0000    3.001076  13.847073\nOUF              108.0571    2.462135  15.168212\nOU anisotropic   350.1016    3.654844   8.005831\nOUf anisotropic 2123.5205    0.000000 359.910030\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"7080\"\n                    ΔAICc ΔRMSPE (km) DOF[area]\nOUF anisotropic    0.0000    2.230820  23.94430\nOUF               73.9577    2.820220  21.23700\nOU anisotropic   216.7409    2.475281  15.64506\nOUf anisotropic 1048.6776    0.000000 278.59866\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese look okay, but they aren’t capturing the short timescales well in all instances.

Let’s plot our step length time series again but with colours representing 0.05 m bins of snow depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like once snow is deeper than ~0.1 m on average, muskox movement decreases well beyond the typical summer step lengths. Of note in the winter of 2010-2011, the snow is especially deep for an extended period of time and step lengths are at their lowest.\nTo define seasons, let’s use a cut-off of 0.1 m snow depth.

    "text": "Muskox Calving\nMovement behaviour in spring may be related to calving. Previous studies in Greenland have shown that muskoxen benefit from earlier spring green-up (Eikelenboom et al., 2021), so muskoxen may be able to alter their movement behaviour depending on green-up timing. In 2008 and 2009, surveys were flown to relocate collared muskoxen to see if they were accompanied by calves. We can plot these data on graphs of step lengths in the spring to investigate how approximate calving dates impact movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing the graphs of muskoxen that were observed to be accompanied by a calf to those that were not, there does not appear to be a major difference in the general trend for step lengths. 7013 in 2009 is the only trajectory to show a sudden decrease in step lengths that resembles those used to determine calving dates for caribou (Bonar et al., 2018; DeMars et al., 2013), but this signal is not present for any of the other muskoxen. For most muskoxen, there is a marked increase in step length in mid-May, but this does not appear to be related to calving dates. The survey data shows that in almost all spring surveys (April onwards), the collared muskoxen were in groups consisting of other females with calves. Only 7010 in 2009 was in a group that wasn’t observed to contain calves until the June survey. I am not sure if these observations",

I’m not sure if these are concerning, but some of the odd variograms would suggest they are.\nAnother thing to consider is that for some muskoxen, there appears to be some periodicity in their movement, which affects the home rnage estimates. 708 is a good example where the semi-variance decreases at certain times leading to an underestimated variogram model. This causes the fairly conservative home range estimate.\nLastly, these models don’t account for barrier to muskox movement. 7080 in particular has a lake in its home range that it travles around. This is probably why the home range estimate is split into different sections despite the variogram suggesting a range resident individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere does not appear to be a strong relationship between the days that a collar was active and the size of the home range. The muskox with the second most number of days has the highest home range estimate, but the muskox with the least amount of days has the second highest estimate.\nThe range of home range sizes overlaps with a study conducted for 11 muskoxen in Bathhurst, Devon, and Cornwallis (233 - 2494 km2; Anderson and Ferguson, 2016). They used minimum convext polygons with up to three years of data for each muskox.",

Let’s start by setting a cut-off for each season to be included in this analysis. Since muskoxen are moving around a lot in the summer, we’ll specify that we want relocations from the full season. There were two muskoxen that had their collars come off in August, so these were not considered when estimating summer home ranges. We captured full calving seasons in all but one instance (708 in 2008). Collars were typically deployed and removed during the winter, so there were several instances where we did not have relocations for the full winter season. For now we will use cutoff of three months (90 days). Winter typically lasts from end of October to our cutoff of April 1st. This ensures roughly 60% of the season is included for winter. Later we’ll compare different lengths of data to see the effect on home range estimates.\nmusk_collar_seas &lt;- musk_season_length %&gt;%\n  ### create groupings for muskoxen (7012 and 7013 overlap but the rest are separated)\n  mutate(range_id = str_c(Id_Number,\"_\",year_min,\"_\",season),\n         group = ifelse(Id_Number %in% c(7012,7013),\n                        \"7012_13\", str_c(Id_Number))) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Id_Number) %&gt;%\n  mutate(max_date = max(date),\n         min_date = min(date)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(range_id) %&gt;%\n  mutate(flag = ifelse(max(date)==max_date|min(date)==min_date,1,0)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  filter(flag == 0|\n           season == \"Calving\"&seas_length &gt;= 28|\n           season == \"Winter\"&seas_length &gt;=90|\n           season == \"Summer\"&seas_length &gt;= 120,\n         ### remove this calving season as the collar seems to have fallen off \n         ### part way through the season\n         range_id != \"706_2009_Calving\") %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(range_id = factor(range_id)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(range_id)\n\nmusk_collar_seas %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(range_id, season) %&gt;%\n  summarise(length = median(seas_length)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(season) %&gt;%\n  summarise(yday = mean(length))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  season  yday          \n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;drtn&gt;        \n1 Summer  172.00000 days\n2 Winter  139.83333 days\n3 Calving  40.73333 days\n\nxy &lt;- musk_collar_seas %&gt;%\n  sf::st_transform(\"+proj=utm +zone=9\") %&gt;%\n  sf::st_coordinates()\nmusk_ltraj &lt;- adehabitatLT::as.ltraj(xy = xy, date = musk_collar_seas$datetime, id = musk_collar_seas$range_id)\nOur first step towards creating seasonal home ranges is to determine GPS accuracy using stationary GPS data. We can use data from collar 707 as this collar was confirmed to have released early. We will calculate the standard deviation of the euclidean distances to estimate GPS accuracy. This will be used as the sig2 parameter in our models and can be used to help estimate the other model parameter, sig1, which is related to home range size.\nWe can then fit movement models for each muskox for each season and estimate utilization distributions. From these distributions we can compare size and overlap between seasons, years, and muskoxen.\nBelow we plot an example seasonal range as well as a comparison between 90% seasonal ranges and 50% core seasonal ranges for each season.\nsig2 &lt;- musk_collar_cal %&gt;%\n  sf::st_transform(\"+proj=utm +zone=9\") %&gt;%\n  filter(Id_Number == 707) %&gt;%\n  mutate(x = sf::st_coordinates(geometry)[,1],\n         y = sf::st_coordinates(geometry)[,2]) %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(Id_Number) %&gt;%\n  ### calculate distances to estimate euclidean standard deviation (telemetry error)\n  mutate(mean_x = mean(x),\n         mean_y = mean(y),\n         distance = sqrt((x-mean_x)^2+(y-mean_y)^2)) %&gt;%\n  summarise(sd = sd(distance)) %&gt;%\n  pull(sd) %&gt;%\n  mean()\nsig1 &lt;- liker(musk_ltraj, \n              sig2 = sig2, \n              rangesig1 = c(0.1,20),\n              plotit = FALSE)\nbbox &lt;- musk_collar_seas %&gt;%\n  sf::st_transform(\"+proj=utm +zone=9\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(x = sf::st_coordinates(geometry)[,1],\n         y = sf::st_coordinates(geometry)[,2]) %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry()  %&gt;%\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(xmin = min(x),\n         xmax = max(x),\n         ymin = min(y),\n         ymax = max(y))\n\nsp_pixels = list()\nfor(i in 1:nrow(bbox)){\n  coords &lt;- expand.grid(x = seq(bbox$xmin[i]-5000,bbox$xmax[i]+5000,100),\n                      y = seq(bbox$ymin[i]-5000,bbox$ymax[i]+5000,100))\n  sf_points &lt;- st_as_sf(coords, coords = c(\"x\", \"y\"), crs = \"+proj=utm +zone=9\")\n  sp_points &lt;- as(sf_points, \"Spatial\")\n  sp_pixels[[bbox$group[i]]] &lt;- SpatialPixels(sp_points)\n}\n\nmusk_bb &lt;- list()\nlookup &lt;- musk_collar_seas %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(range_id, group) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n# for(i in 1:length(sig1)){\n#   musk_bb[[i]] &lt;- kernelbb(musk_ltraj[i],\n#                            sig1 = sig1[[i]]$sig1,\n#                            sig2 = sig2,\n#                            grid=sp_pixels[[lookup$group[i]]])\n# }\n# saveRDS(musk_bb, here(\"data/processed/musk_bb.rds\"))\nmusk_bb &lt;- readRDS(here(\"data/processed/musk_bb.rds\"))\nLet’s take a look at the contour plots for each individual to make sure they look okay:\nLoading basemap 'topographic' from map service 'osm'...\nUsing geom_raster() with maxpixels = 659712.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading basemap 'topographic' from map service 'osm'...\nUsing geom_raster() with maxpixels = 520010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading basemap 'topographic' from map service 'osm'...\nUsing geom_raster() with maxpixels = 362340.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading basemap 'topographic' from map service 'osm'...\nUsing geom_raster() with maxpixels = 362340.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading basemap 'topographic' from map service 'osm'...\nUsing geom_raster() with maxpixels = 550715.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading basemap 'topographic' from map service 'osm'...\nUsing geom_raster() with maxpixels = 747830.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading basemap 'topographic' from map service 'osm'...\nUsing geom_raster() with maxpixels = 523905.\nThese look reasonable. Let’s also plot the seasonal range sizes to compare between individuals and years:\nThere are some large ranges in 2009, particularly for 7011 (summer and calving), 7010 winter, 7012 calving, and 708 winter.\nInterestingly, summer home range sizes are fairly consistent within individuals and between the two individuals (7012 and 7013) that overlap in space use. Perhaps the land cover or topography of the area plays a large role in determining home range size. This is not the case with winter or calving range, which show a lot of variability within individuals, but appear to be similar within years. This suggests a role of weather (e.g. snow depth) in determining winter and calving range size, though differences in topography and land cover could still account for the variation seen in some years (e.g. 2009). Let’s compare these differences using mean absolute percentage differences for range sizes\nseason\nmean_percent_diff_id\nmean_percent_diff_year\n\n\n\n\nSummer\n0.07\n0.38\n\n\nWinter\n0.66\n0.32\n\n\nCalving\n0.51\n0.45",

The first graph shows the percent overlap of an individual’s 95% home range contour from different seasons and years. Home rqanges represented by columns are compared against home ranges represented by rows and separated by different year lags.\nThe second graph depicts the probability that an individual with a utilization distribution represented by the row is found in the 95% home range contour represented by the column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few patterns are clear from these graphs:\n\nSummer home ranges shared ~40% of their area across years.\nWinter and calving home ranges typically shared a high overlap with summer ranges, especially those from the same year. However, there was a lot of variation in this overlap, with some seasons having near 100% overlap and some having very little overlap.\nCalving season ranges shared a high overlap with the winter season range immediately preceding it, but there was considerable variation in this overlap.\nWinter and calving season ranges showed negligible overlap across years, suggesting low seasonal range fidelity.\n\nLastly, let’s look at the comparison of seasonal ranges between muskox 7012 and 7013, which were the only muskoxen that overlapped in space and time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highest overlap is during the summer. These muskoxen do not appear to share large areas during the winter or calving season and despite being found in the same location occasionally, they appeared to wander on their own for most of the time they were collared.",

In addition, each muskox with multiple years of data had a smaller winter home range in the year with deeper snow.\nIt’s also worth noting that the three instances with the deepest snow all occurred in 2010, but all three home ranges occurred in spatially distinct areas. There could be another weather variable correlated with years that is responsible for the relationship, but snow depth seems the most plausible given previous research. Also, if we include the three winter home ranges that were only calculated for part of the season (due to starting or ending mid winter), they fit the trend as 2007 and 2011 were also years with deeper snow.",

Given that we do not actually know which females had calves every year, the presence/absence of calves could have a large impact on the area traversed during this time. For instance, we know that muskox 7010 in 2009 was not seen with a calf during any of the surveys and happens to have the largest home range size during the calving season. Similarly, muskox 7012 in 2009, which had the second largest home range, was not with a calf until May at the earliest. This means 7012 was not restricted from moving around during the deepest parts of the calving season. Removing these two points makes for a much stronger relationship; however this pattern is not universal as there were other muskoxen in 2008 and 2009 that were without calves during April and still had small home ranges. The fact that these muskoxen travel in groups needs to be taken into consideration as well because even if the collared muskoxen does not have a calf, its movements may still be restricted by the movements of the group. Most groups observed in 2008 and 2009 had at least one calf during the calving season. One exception was 7010 in 2009, which was observed to be in a group with a calf at the beginning of April but not in May.",

Like winter and calving season models, we will stick with one predictor variable to avoid issues with overfitting. In this case, we will look at the percentage of shrubland and grassland within each home range, with the hypothesis that areas with less shrubland/grassland will mean muskoxen will need to travel further to meet their energy demands and consequently have larger home ranges.\nWe’ll start by loading the land cover data and calculating percent cover.\n\nlc_2010_crop &lt;- terra::rast(here(\"data/processed/lc_2010_crop.tif\"))\nlc_atts &lt;- readRDS(here(\"data/processed/lc_atts.rds\"))\n### land cover ids 8 and 10 coorespond to the land covers of interest\nlcc_func &lt;- function(id, range){\n  points &lt;- musk_seascont %&gt;%\n    filter(range_id == !!id, range == !!range) %&gt;%\n    sf::st_transform(terra::crs(lc_2010_crop))\n  lc_2010_crop2 &lt;- terra::crop(lc_2010_crop, points)\n  zones &lt;- rasterize(points %&gt;%\n                        terra::vect(),\n                    lc_2010_crop2, touches = TRUE)\n  ct &lt;- crosstab(c(zones, lc_2010_crop2)) %&gt;%\n    as_tibble() %&gt;%\n    mutate(range_id = !!id,\n           range = !!range)\n}\n\nmusk_sum_home &lt;- musk_seascont %&gt;%\n  filter(season == \"Summer\",\n         range == \"home\") %&gt;%\n  pull(range_id) %&gt;%\n  map(function(.x){lcc_func(.x, \"home\")}) %&gt;%\n  list_rbind() \nmusk_sum_core &lt;- musk_seascont %&gt;%\n  filter(season == \"Summer\",\n         range == \"core\") %&gt;%\n  pull(range_id) %&gt;%\n  map(function(.x){lcc_func(.x, \"core\")}) %&gt;%\n  list_rbind() \nmusk_sum &lt;- bind_rows(musk_sum_home, musk_sum_core)\n\n\nmusk_sum_sum &lt;- musk_sum %&gt;%\n  mutate(for_lc = ifelse(Canada2010%in%c(8,10,11,12,13),1,0)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(range_id, range) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total = sum(n),\n            for_tot = sum(n*for_lc),\n            for_per = for_tot/total) %&gt;%\n  left_join(musk_seascont %&gt;%\n              select(range_id, range, year_min, seas_length, area, Id_Number)) \n\nmusk_sum_sum %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = for_per, y = log(area), colour = Id_Number)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  facet_wrap(~range, scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsum_home_mod &lt;- nlme::lme(log(area)~scale(for_per), random=~1|Id_Number, \n                 data = musk_sum_sum %&gt;% filter(range == \"home\"))\nsummary(sum_home_mod)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n  Data: musk_sum_sum %&gt;% filter(range == \"home\") \n       AIC      BIC   logLik\n  14.21694 15.80852 -3.10847\n\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ~1 | Id_Number\n        (Intercept)   Residual\nStdDev:   0.5533838 0.09158007\n\nFixed effects:  log(area) ~ scale(for_per) \n                  Value  Std.Error DF  t-value p-value\n(Intercept)    9.690539 0.21127654  6 45.86661  0.0000\nscale(for_per) 0.154817 0.07617671  5  2.03235  0.0978\n Correlation: \n               (Intr)\nscale(for_per) 0.046 \n\nStandardized Within-Group Residuals:\n        Min          Q1         Med          Q3         Max \n-1.48503085 -0.29697479  0.01338312  0.29728898  1.44623295 \n\nNumber of Observations: 13\nNumber of Groups: 7 \n\nsum_core_mod &lt;- nlme::lme(log(area)~scale(for_per), random=~1|Id_Number, \n                 data = musk_sum_sum %&gt;% filter(range == \"core\"))\nsummary(sum_core_mod)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n  Data: musk_sum_sum %&gt;% filter(range == \"core\") \n      AIC      BIC    logLik\n  28.5491 30.14068 -10.27455\n\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ~1 | Id_Number\n        (Intercept) Residual\nStdDev:   0.4624548 0.344547\n\nFixed effects:  log(area) ~ scale(for_per) \n                   Value Std.Error DF  t-value p-value\n(Intercept)     7.475775 0.2033897  6 36.75592  0.0000\nscale(for_per) -0.041506 0.1359836  5 -0.30523  0.7725\n Correlation: \n               (Intr)\nscale(for_per) 0.049 \n\nStandardized Within-Group Residuals:\n       Min         Q1        Med         Q3        Max \n-1.2452052 -0.3128850 -0.1099126  0.3078064  1.3706162 \n\nNumber of Observations: 13\nNumber of Groups: 7 \n\n\nA lot of the variation in home range size is explained by differences in individual muskoxen; i.e. summer home ranges are similar in size across seasons, and we already know that they share high overlap across years.\nThe relationship with forage percent cover is in opposition to the original hypothesis. Larger home ranges appear to be correlated with a larger percent of forage land cover, though not significant. Maybe if there is a high density of foraging areas, it makes sense to target foraging areas that haven’t been visited lately so there is a maximal amount of forage. For individuals in areas with low density of foraging areas, maybe it makes more sense to not travel long distances to new foraging patches and just stay with the ones that are nearby. By this logic, we might expect the area immediately surrounding home ranges to have a low density of forage areas.\nBefore we compare the areas inside and outside of summer home ranges lets look to see if season length has any effect on summer season size.\n\nmusk_seascont %&gt;%\n  filter(season == \"Summer\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = seas_length, y = log(area), colour = Id_Number)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  facet_wrap(~range, scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsum_home_length_mod &lt;- nlme::lme(log(area)~scale(seas_length), \n                                 random=~1|Id_Number, \n                                 data = musk_seascont %&gt;%\n                                   filter(season == \"Summer\",\n                                          range == \"home\"))\nsummary(sum_home_length_mod)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n  Data: musk_seascont %&gt;% filter(season == \"Summer\", range == \"home\") \n       AIC      BIC    logLik\n  19.26688 20.85847 -5.633442\n\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ~1 | Id_Number\n        (Intercept)  Residual\nStdDev:    0.571339 0.1181319\n\nFixed effects:  log(area) ~ scale(seas_length) \n                       Value  Std.Error DF  t-value p-value\n(Intercept)         9.667974 0.21899982  6 44.14604  0.0000\nscale(seas_length) -0.017532 0.03506181  5 -0.50004  0.6383\n Correlation: \n                   (Intr)\nscale(seas_length) 0.012 \n\nStandardized Within-Group Residuals:\n        Min          Q1         Med          Q3         Max \n-0.91514860 -0.45820525 -0.04983494  0.37470354  1.36346760 \n\nNumber of Observations: 13\nNumber of Groups: 7 \n\nsum_core_length_mod &lt;- nlme::lme(log(area)~scale(seas_length), \n                                 random=~1|Id_Number, \n                                 data = musk_seascont %&gt;%\n                                   filter(season == \"Summer\",\n                                          range == \"core\"))\nsummary(sum_core_length_mod)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n  Data: musk_seascont %&gt;% filter(season == \"Summer\", range == \"core\") \n       AIC      BIC    logLik\n  29.02305 30.61463 -10.51152\n\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ~1 | Id_Number\n        (Intercept)  Residual\nStdDev:    0.437158 0.3543469\n\nFixed effects:  log(area) ~ scale(seas_length) \n                      Value Std.Error DF  t-value p-value\n(Intercept)        7.477336 0.1964249  6 38.06715  0.0000\nscale(seas_length) 0.041025 0.1042371  5  0.39357  0.7101\n Correlation: \n                   (Intr)\nscale(seas_length) 0.026 \n\nStandardized Within-Group Residuals:\n       Min         Q1        Med         Q3        Max \n-1.3339226 -0.3702696 -0.1420074  0.3614694  1.2874125 \n\nNumber of Observations: 13\nNumber of Groups: 7 \n\n\nThere is no significant relationship. If anything, there is a slight negative trend with season length. In fact, as we observed previously, summer home ranges are fairly consistent in size within individuals despite differences in season length across years (see 7011, 7012, 7013, and 708 in graph above), meaning our previous finding of the availability of foraging patches is probably more important.",

It might be more informational to compare topography or land cover within the home range with topography and land cover immediately surrounding the home range. If land cover has a lower proportion of foraging areas or topography is rougher outside of the home range, then maybe these factors are responsible for the size of the home ranges.\nWe will use a buffer of 7 km to start.

This suggests that forage availability may limit muskox. Using smaller buffers of 2km and 5 km produced the same result. Given that many summer home ranges are bordered by lakes, the percent cover of lakes in the surrounding area could be responsible for some differences in forage cover, but even if we remove lakes from the calculation (not shown here), we still get a significant difference.\nLet’s do the same test but with terrain ruggedness index to assess if the terrain surrounding home ranges is more rough than the terrain within home ranges. We would expect that muskoxen would be less likely to travel through rough terrain\n\nmusk_ter %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = group, y = value)) +\n  geom_boxplot() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsum_mod &lt;- nlme::lme(value~group, random=~1|Id_Number/year_min, \n                 data = musk_ter)\nsummary(sum_mod)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n  Data: musk_ter \n       AIC      BIC    logLik\n  58.06474 63.95501 -24.03237\n\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ~1 | Id_Number\n        (Intercept)\nStdDev:    1.321859\n\n Formula: ~1 | year_min %in% Id_Number\n         (Intercept)  Residual\nStdDev: 9.240511e-06 0.3699254\n\nFixed effects:  value ~ group \n                    Value Std.Error DF  t-value p-value\n(Intercept)     2.0852115 0.5112368 12 4.078759  0.0015\ngrouphome range 0.4055481 0.1450967 12 2.795020  0.0162\n Correlation: \n                (Intr)\ngrouphome range -0.142\n\nStandardized Within-Group Residuals:\n        Min          Q1         Med          Q3         Max \n-1.73036205 -0.59522723 -0.01339007  0.61749071  1.74135855 \n\nNumber of Observations: 26\nNumber of Groups: \n              Id_Number year_min %in% Id_Number \n                      7                      13 \n\n\nIf anything, it appears that the terrain is more rugged within home ranges though the difference is not huge (20% increase on average). Maybe the land cover they are interested in is more associated with rough terrain such as that close to the mountains.",

However, this difference appears to increase as you increase the buffer size, going to 31 m when the buffer size is doubled and 51 m when the buffer size is quadrupled. It’s also worth noting that there is a positive increase in elevation in all but two instances and the largest increases happen at higher elevations.

    "text": "In this document, we will use integrated step selection analysis (iSSA) to model movement decisions of the Sahtu muskoxen. Models will be fit using the amt package. We’ll start by loading the data and required packages:\n### group data by ID and season\nmusk_collar_season &lt;- musk_collar_filt %&gt;%\n  left_join(snowdepth_locs) %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, Id_Number) %&gt;%\n  mutate(season = season_delineation(datetime, snow_depth, 0.01),\n         # season = ifelse(month &gt;= 4 & month &lt;= 7 & season == \"winter\", \"calving\", season),\n         year_min = minimum_year_season(year,datetime,season))  %&gt;%\n  mutate(id_season = str_c(Id_Number,\"_\",season)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() \n\nJoining with `by = join_by(Id_Number, Latitude, Longitude, datetime)`\nNext let’s look at some of the relationships between the spatial data we’ll be using in the models. First let’s look at historical fire data and how it relates to forest cover data:\nlayer                                             value   count  freq\n1      1          Temperate or sub-polar needleleaf forest 6834296 0.295\n2      1                 Sub-polar taiga needleleaf forest 9012663 0.389\n3      1 Temperate or sub-polar broadleaf deciduous forest    4721 0.000\n4      1                                      Mixed forest  259389 0.011\n5      1                  Temperate or sub-polar shrubland 1780507 0.077\n6      1                  Temperate or sub-polar grassland 1118608 0.048\n7      1          Sub-polar or polar shrubland-lichen-moss   26117 0.001\n8      1          Sub-polar or polar grassland-lichen-moss   67969 0.003\n9      1                                           Wetland 1214924 0.052\n10     1                                      Barren Lands  281304 0.012\n11     1                                Urban and built-up    9547 0.000\n12     1                                             Water 2581939 0.111\n13     1                                      Snow and Ice      15 0.000\nThe first image shows that muskoxen appear to favour areas impacted by recent fires to some degree. The second image shows that canopy cover is also impacted by recent fires, although the relative recency of the fire doesn’t seem to have a large effect on differences in canopy cover across areas impacted by fires. In any case, it will be important to account for changes in canopy cover that have occurred since the collars stopped recording as these areas likely had higher canopy cover during the monitoring period.\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n=========================================\n                                          \n\n\n\n\n\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n=========================================\nThere does seem to be avoidance of some areas with high TRI values, however muskox do appear to cross ridge tops to get to potential foraging areas on the other side. Lastly, let’s look at the proximity to water and how it relates to muskox movements.\nDoesn’t seem to be a huge correlation between GPS points and proximity to water, but still worth exploring further in some models.\nTo see if temperature extremes have an effect on movement behaviour in the winter and summer let’s overlay temperature data with collar data.

Models are fit using the ISSA method that allows for random effects. This way we can automatically pool estimates across individuals to come up with a population-level estimate for each covariate. We’ll run a fire and landcover model for each season.\n\nm0_summer_glmmfit &lt;- glmmTMB(case_ ~ -1 + scale(log_sl)*scale(cos_ta) + \n                               # scale(scanfi_prcC_end) +\n                               scale(mrdtm) +\n                               scale(log_water_dist) +\n                               scale(log_fire_dist) +\n                               scale(log_fire_dist):fire_10_dup +\n                               scale(log_fire_dist):fire_20_dup +\n                               scale(log_fire_dist):fire_30_dup +\n                               scale(log_fire_dist):fire_40_dup +\n                               scale(tpi) +\n                               water +\n                               #

    "text": "Movement Trends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the time series above, movement tends to be highest in the summer (June, July, August), gradually decrease during autumn (September, October, November) and winter (December, January, February) and experience a sharp increase in the late spring (May). Perhaps this increase is timed with parturition, which has been found to start in April/May (Adamczewski 1997). Alternatively, this could be tied to the timing of snowmelt. We can explore this further by looking at average seasonal step lengths for each muskox:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep lengths in the winter and spring are similar, whereas autumn step lengths are intermediate between winter and summer. This again highlights the discrepancy between the gradual decrease in step lengths from summer to winter compared with the sharper increase from winter to summer.\nFor the most part, average seasonal step lengths are consistent between muskoxen, though there appear to be greater variation in the spring and autumn. To examine this further, let’s plot smoothed curves of step lengths against day of year for different years. We’ll restrict this plot to muskoxen-year combinations with more than half a year’s worth of data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe curves of step lengths follow similar trajectories but there is still considerable variation across years and among muskoxen. This suggests weather, landscape, and muskox characteristics may play a part in influencing movement behaviour.",

The relationship appears to be exponential as well, with changes in step length becoming smaller as step length becomes smaller. Let’s plot our step length time series again but with colours representing 0.05 m bins of snow depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like once snow is deeper than ~0.1 m on average, muskox movement decreases well beyond the typical summer step lengths. Of note in the winter of 2010-2011, the snow is especially deep for an extended period of time and step lengths are at their lowest.\nTo define seasons, let’s use a cut-off of 0.1 m snow depth. We’ll define the start of winter as the first three successive days with snow depth &gt;=0.1 m and the end of winter as the first three successive days with snow depth &lt;=0.1 m.\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\nstart_summer\nstart_winter\nlength_summer\nlength_winter\n\n\n\n\n2007\n2007-05-20\n2007-10-11\n144\n214\n\n\n2008\n2008-05-12\n2008-10-25\n166\n193\n\n\n2009\n2009-05-06\n2009-11-18\n196\n159\n\n\n2010\n2010-04-26\n2010-11-04\n192\n199\n\n\n2011\n2011-05-22\n2011-10-19\n150\n217\n\n\n2012\n2012-05-23\n2012-09-11\n111\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also look at the movement trajectories of muskoxen at the transitions between seasons to decide on cutoffs specific to each individual.

    "text": "Muskox Calving\nMovement behaviour in spring may be related to calving. Previous studies in Greenland have shown that muskoxen benefit from earlier spring green-up (Eikelenboom et al., 2021), so muskoxen may be able to alter their movement behaviour depending on green-up timing. In 2008 and 2009, surveys were flown to relocate collared muskoxen to see if they were accompanied by calves. We can plot these data on graphs of step lengths in the spring to investigate how approximate calving dates impact movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing the graphs of muskoxen that were observed to be accompanied by a calf to those that were not, there does not appear to be a major difference in the general trend for step lengths. 7013 in 2009 is the only trajectory to show a sudden decrease in step lengths that resembles those used to determine calving dates for caribou (Bonar et al., 2018; DeMars et al., 2013), but this signal is not present for any of the other muskoxen. For most muskoxen, there is a marked increase in step length in mid-May, but this does not appear to be related to calving dates. The survey data shows that in almost all spring surveys (April onwards), the collared muskoxen were in groups consisting of other females with calves. Only 7010 in 2009 was in a group that wasn’t observed to contain calves until the June survey. I am not sure if these observations",

See Bunnefeld et al. (2011) for examples of how these curves look for different movement classes (i.e. migrant, disperser, resident, nomad).\nTo do this we will use the adehabitatLT package to format our data and the migrateR package to fit different models to the net displacement data. Let’s first get our collar data into the trajectory format used by adehabitatLT. We will also subset our data to one observation per day to improve modelling efficiency.\n\nmusk_collar_sub &lt;- musk_collar_filt %&gt;%\n  filter(lubridate::hour(datetime) == 16)\n\nxy &lt;- musk_collar_sub %&gt;%\n  sf::st_transform(\"+proj=utm +zone=9\") %&gt;%\n  sf::st_coordinates()\nltraj &lt;- adehabitatLT::as.ltraj(xy = xy, date = musk_collar_sub$datetime, id = musk_collar_sub$Id_Number)\n\nadehabitatLT::ld(ltraj) %&gt;%\n  filter(!(id %in% c(707,709,710))) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = R2n)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.5) +\n  geom_line() +\n  ylab(\"Net squared displacement (km^2)\") +\n  xlab(\"Date\") +\n  facet_wrap(~id) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the net squared displacement from the initial location for each collared muskoxen. There does not appear to be a clear movement behaviour shared between all muskoxen. Most appear to have short periods of time during the summer with large net squared displacement, but these are generally followed by longer periods where net squared displacement is much smaller. Muskoxen 7011 and 7012 show a general increasing trend in net squared displacement, but there are still extended periods of smaller displacement throughout the time series. Most of the periods of larger displacement do not appear to be long enough to represent a separate summer range. Examinations of animations of muskox movements generally show that they tend to move between patches of resources during the summer rather than sticking to one specific area.",

Since we have few observations per season (sample size 12 - 15), we want 1 - 2 explantory variables per season model. Average snow cover during the winter and calving seasons may impact home range size, with individuals being restricted from moving large distances. During the summer, the percent of landcover suitable for foraging or number of foraging patches may impact the size of home ranges with larger home ranges occurring when individuals need to travel more often or further to get to foraging areas. Other barriers to movement may also affect home range size, including ridges and lakes.",

In addition, each muskox with multiple years of data had a smaller winter home range in the year with deeper snow.\nIt’s also worth noting that the three instances with the deepest snow all occurred in 2010, but all three home ranges occurred in spatially distinct areas. There could be another weather variable correlated with years that is responsible for the relationship, but snow depth seems the most plausible given previous research. Also, if we include the three winter home ranges that were only calculated for part of the season (due to starting or ending mid winter), they fit the trend as 2007 and 2011 were also years with deeper snow.",

Given that we do not actually know which females had calves every year, the presence/absence of calves could have a large impact on the area traversed during this time. For instance, we know that muskox 7010 in 2009 was not seen with a calf during any of the surveys and happens to have the largest home range size during the calving season. Similarly, muskox 7012 in 2009, which had the second largest home range, was not with a calf until May at the earliest. This means 7012 was not restricted from moving around during the deepest parts of the calving season. Removing these two points makes for a much stronger relationship; however this pattern is not universal as there were other muskoxen in 2008 and 2009 that were without calves during April and still had small home ranges. The fact that these muskoxen travel in groups needs to be taken into consideration as well because even if the collared muskoxen does not have a calf, its movements may still be restricted by the movements of the group. Most groups observed in 2008 and 2009 had at least one calf during the calving season. One exception was 7010 in 2009, which was observed to be in a group with a calf at the beginning of April but not in May.",

In this case, we will look at the percentage of shrubland and grassland within each home range, with the hypothesis that areas with less shrubland/grassland will mean muskoxen will need to travel further to meet their energy demands and consequently have larger home ranges.\nWe’ll start by loading the land cover data and calculating percent cover.\n\nlc_2010_crop &lt;- terra::rast(here(\"data/processed/lc_2010_crop.tif\"))\nlc_atts &lt;- readRDS(here(\"data/processed/lc_atts.rds\"))\n### land cover ids 8 and 10 coorespond to the land covers of interest\nlcc_func &lt;- function(id, range){\n  points &lt;- musk_seascont %&gt;%\n    filter(range_id == !!id, range == !!range) %&gt;%\n    sf::st_transform(terra::crs(lc_2010_crop))\n  lc_2010_crop2 &lt;- terra::crop(lc_2010_crop, points)\n  zones &lt;- rasterize(points %&gt;%\n                        terra::vect(),\n                    lc_2010_crop2, touches = TRUE)\n  ct &lt;- crosstab(c(zones, lc_2010_crop2)) %&gt;%\n    as_tibble() %&gt;%\n    mutate(range_id = !!id,\n           range = !!range)\n}\n\nmusk_sum_home &lt;- musk_seascont %&gt;%\n  filter(season == \"Summer\",\n         range == \"home\") %&gt;%\n  pull(range_id) %&gt;%\n  map(function(.x){lcc_func(.x, \"home\")}) %&gt;%\n  list_rbind() \nmusk_sum_core &lt;- musk_seascont %&gt;%\n  filter(season == \"Summer\",\n         range == \"core\") %&gt;%\n  pull(range_id) %&gt;%\n  map(function(.x){lcc_func(.x, \"core\")}) %&gt;%\n  list_rbind() \nmusk_sum &lt;- bind_rows(musk_sum_home, musk_sum_core)\n\n\nmusk_sum_sum &lt;- musk_sum %&gt;%\n  mutate(for_lc = ifelse(cover%in%c(\"Temperate or sub-polar shrubland\",\n                                    \"Temperate or sub-polar grassland\",\n                                    \"Sub-polar or polar shrubland-lichen-moss\",\n                                    \"Sub-polar or polar grassland-lichen-moss\",\n                                    \"Sub-polar or polar barren-lichen-moss\"),1,0)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(range_id, range) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total = sum(n),\n            for_tot = sum(n*for_lc),\n            for_per = for_tot/total) %&gt;%\n  left_join(musk_seascont %&gt;%\n              select(range_id, range, year_min, seas_length, area, Id_Number)) \n\nmusk_sum_sum %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = for_per, y = log(area), colour = Id_Number)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  facet_wrap(~range, scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsum_home_mod &lt;- nlme::lme(log(area)~scale(for_per), random=~1|Id_Number, \n                 data = musk_sum_sum %&gt;% filter(range == \"home\"))\nsummary(sum_home_mod)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n  Data: musk_sum_sum %&gt;% filter(range == \"home\") \n       AIC      BIC   logLik\n  14.21694 15.80852 -3.10847\n\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ~1 | Id_Number\n        (Intercept)   Residual\nStdDev:   0.5533838 0.09158007\n\nFixed effects:  log(area) ~ scale(for_per) \n                  Value  Std.Error DF  t-value p-value\n(Intercept)    9.690539 0.21127654  6 45.86661  0.0000\nscale(for_per) 0.154817 0.07617671  5  2.03235  0.0978\n Correlation: \n               (Intr)\nscale(for_per) 0.046 \n\nStandardized Within-Group Residuals:\n        Min          Q1         Med          Q3         Max \n-1.48503085 -0.29697479  0.01338312  0.29728898  1.44623295 \n\nNumber of Observations: 13\nNumber of Groups: 7 \n\nsum_core_mod &lt;- nlme::lme(log(area)~scale(for_per), random=~1|Id_Number, \n                 data = musk_sum_sum %&gt;% filter(range == \"core\"))\nsummary(sum_core_mod)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n  Data: musk_sum_sum %&gt;% filter(range == \"core\") \n      AIC      BIC    logLik\n  28.5491 30.14068 -10.27455\n\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ~1 | Id_Number\n        (Intercept) Residual\nStdDev:   0.4624548 0.344547\n\nFixed effects:  log(area) ~ scale(for_per) \n                   Value Std.Error DF  t-value p-value\n(Intercept)     7.475775 0.2033897  6 36.75592  0.0000\nscale(for_per) -0.041506 0.1359836  5 -0.30523  0.7725\n Correlation: \n               (Intr)\nscale(for_per) 0.049 \n\nStandardized Within-Group Residuals:\n       Min         Q1        Med         Q3        Max \n-1.2452052 -0.3128850 -0.1099126  0.3078064  1.3706162 \n\nNumber of Observations: 13\nNumber of Groups: 7 \n\n\nA lot of the variation in home range size is explained by differences in individual muskoxen; i.e. summer home ranges are similar in size across seasons, and we already know that they share high overlap across years.\nThe relationship with forage percent cover is in opposition to the original hypothesis. Larger home ranges appear to be correlated with a larger percent of forage land cover, though not significant. Maybe if there is a high density of foraging areas, it makes sense to target foraging areas that haven’t been visited lately so there is a maximal amount of forage. For individuals in areas with low density of foraging areas, maybe it makes more sense to not travel long distances to new foraging patches and just stay with the ones that are nearby. By this logic, we might expect the area immediately surrounding home ranges to have a low density of forage areas.\nBefore we compare the areas inside and outside of summer home ranges lets look to see if season length has any effect on summer season size.\n\nmusk_seascont %&gt;%\n  filter(season == \"Summer\") %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = seas_length, y = log(area), colour = Id_Number)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  facet_wrap(~range, scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsum_home_length_mod &lt;- nlme::lme(log(area)~scale(seas_length), \n                                 random=~1|Id_Number, \n                                 data = musk_seascont %&gt;%\n                                   filter(season == \"Summer\",\n                                          range == \"home\"))\nsummary(sum_home_length_mod)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n  Data: musk_seascont %&gt;% filter(season == \"Summer\", range == \"home\") \n       AIC     BIC   logLik\n  19.28732 20.8789 -5.64366\n\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ~1 | Id_Number\n        (Intercept)  Residual\nStdDev:     0.57154 0.1183247\n\nFixed effects:  log(area) ~ scale(seas_length) \n                       Value  Std.Error DF  t-value p-value\n(Intercept)         9.667986 0.21908537  6 44.12885  0.0000\nscale(seas_length) -0.016793 0.03512815  5 -0.47806  0.6528\n Correlation: \n                   (Intr)\nscale(seas_length) 0.012 \n\nStandardized Within-Group Residuals:\n        Min          Q1         Med          Q3         Max \n-0.92448826 -0.44761859 -0.04991734  0.37512118  1.36661453 \n\nNumber of Observations: 13\nNumber of Groups: 7 \n\nsum_core_length_mod &lt;- nlme::lme(log(area)~scale(seas_length), \n                                 random=~1|Id_Number, \n                                 data = musk_seascont %&gt;%\n                                   filter(season == \"Summer\",\n                                          range == \"core\"))\nsummary(sum_core_length_mod)\n\nLinear mixed-effects model fit by REML\n  Data: musk_seascont %&gt;% filter(season == \"Summer\", range == \"core\") \n       AIC      BIC    logLik\n  28.99783 30.58941 -10.49892\n\nRandom effects:\n Formula: ~1 | Id_Number\n        (Intercept)  Residual\nStdDev:   0.4396887 0.3524217\n\nFixed effects:  log(area) ~ scale(seas_length) \n                      Value Std.Error DF  t-value p-value\n(Intercept)        7.478075 0.1969522  6 37.96899  0.0000\nscale(seas_length) 0.044618 0.1037080  5  0.43022  0.6849\n Correlation: \n                   (Intr)\nscale(seas_length) 0.027 \n\nStandardized Within-Group Residuals:\n       Min         Q1        Med         Q3        Max \n-1.3382618 -0.3794572 -0.1413570  0.3749665  1.2782830 \n\nNumber of Observations: 13\nNumber of Groups: 7 \n\n\nThere is no significant relationship. If anything, there is a slight negative trend with season length. In fact, as we observed previously, summer home ranges are fairly consistent in size within individuals despite differences in season length across years (see 7011, 7012, 7013, and 708 in graph above), meaning our previous finding of the availability of foraging patches is probably more important.",

If muskox home ranges are limited in size by topography, it would be more difficult to test for it. It might be more informational to compare topography or land cover within the home range with topography and land cover immediately surrounding the home range. If land cover has a lower proportion of foraging areas or topography is rougher outside of the home range, then maybe these factors are responsible for the size of the home ranges.\nWe will use a buffer of 7 km to start.

This suggests that forage availability may limit muskox. Using smaller buffers of 2km and 5 km produced the same result. Given that many summer home ranges are bordered by lakes, the percent cover of lakes in the surrounding area could be responsible for some differences in forage cover, but even if we remove lakes from the calculation (not shown here), we still get a significant difference.\nLet’s do the same test but with terrain ruggedness index to assess if the terrain surrounding home ranges is more rough than the terrain within home ranges.

However, this difference appears to increase as you increase the buffer size, going to 31 m when the buffer size is doubled and 51 m when the buffer size is quadrupled. It’s also worth noting that there is a positive increase in elevation in all but two instances and the largest increases happen at higher elevations. Given previous discussions, there may be two main areas that muskoxen go to during the winter: steep cliffs at high elevations and lake shores at lower elevations.\nLet’s calculate topographic position index to see if winter home ranges would be classified as hilltops\n\nmrdtm_crop &lt;- terra::rast(here(\"data/processed/mrdtm_crop.tif\"))\ntpi_crop &lt;- terra::terrain(mrdtm_crop, \"TPI\")\ntpi_func &lt;- function(id){\n  points &lt;- musk_seascont %&gt;%\n    filter(range_id == !!id, range == \"home\") %&gt;%\n    st_buffer(dist) %&gt;%\n    st_difference(musk_seascont %&gt;%\n                    filter(range_id == !!id, range == \"home\")) %&gt;%\n    mutate(group = \"buffer\") %&gt;%\n    bind_rows(musk_seascont %&gt;%\n                filter(range_id == !!id, range == \"home\") %&gt;%\n                mutate(group = \"home range\")) %&gt;%\n    sf::st_transform(terra::crs(tpi_crop))\n  tpi_crop2 &lt;- terra::crop(tpi_crop, points)\n  zones &lt;- rasterize(points %&gt;%\n                       terra::vect(),\n                     tpi_crop2, field = \"group\", touches = TRUE)\n  zonal(tpi_crop2, zones, \"mean\", wide = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) %&gt;%\n    mutate(range_id = !!id) %&gt;%\n    select(-layer)\n}\n\n\nmusk_tpi &lt;- musk_seascont %&gt;%\n  filter(season == \"Winter\", range == \"home\", seas_length&gt;115) %&gt;%\n  pull(range_id) %&gt;%\n  map(function(.x){tpi_func(.x)}) %&gt;%\n  list_rbind() %&gt;%\n  left_join(musk_seascont %&gt;%\n              filter(range == \"home\") %&gt;%\n              st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n              select(range_id, Id_Number, year_min))\n\nmusk_tpi %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = group, y = value)) +\n  geom_boxplot() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinter home ranges appear to have a high topographic position index than the adjacent area, meaning they are more likely to be on hill tops.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this document, we will use hidden markov models to distinguish different movement behaviours of muskoxen based on step lengths and turn angles throughout the year. We will use the momentuHMM package to accomplish this.\nThe muskox movement data are collected at 8 h intervals but occasionally there a gaps exceeding 8 hours. The HMM can deal with short gaps but large gaps can lead to increases in model uncertainty. To deal with this, we will split all gaps exceeding 16 hours (i.e. more than one missing data point) into separate bursts. We also separate bursts by season, with summer including snow-free bursts and winter including snow covered bursts. To be conservative, we will define seasons using a cut-off of 0.01 m snow depth. We’ll define the start of winter as the first three successive days with snow depth &gt;=0.01 m and the end of winter as the first three successive days with snow depth &lt;=0.01 m.\n\nmusk_hmm_data &lt;- musk_collar_filt %&gt;%\n  left_join(snowdepth_locs) %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, Id_Number) %&gt;%\n  mutate(season = season_delineation(datetime, snow_depth, 0.1),\n         year_min = minimum_year_season(year,datetime,season)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Id_Number, year_min, season) %&gt;%\n  mutate(burst = burst_delineation(pTime, gap_threshold = 48),\n         burst_id = str_c(Id_Number,\"_\",year_min,\"_\",season,\"_\",burst)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n### filter out short bursts, i.e. less than 4 weeks worth of data (28days x 3 obs/day = 84 obs)\nburst_plot(musk_hmm_data, id = \"burst_id\", length_threshold = 84)\n\nmusk_hmm_data_filter &lt;- burst_filter(musk_hmm_data, id = \"burst_id\", threshold = 84) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(ID = burst_id) %&gt;%\n  ### coordinates need to be UTM for the crawlWrap function\n  sf::st_transform(32609)\n\nNow that we have our individual bursts, we will fill short gaps from each burst using the crawlWrap function, which interpolates locations for each gap. We will do this separately for each season. We will also specify a prior to help keep the models within realistic limits. This function will provide an error model for the data that we can use to simulate locations for the missing data.\n\nprior_winter &lt;- function(p){\n  dnorm(p[1], 4, 1, log = TRUE) +\n    dnorm(p[2], -0.5, 1, log = TRUE)\n}\n\nprior_summer &lt;- function(p){\n  dnorm(p[1], 6, 1, log = TRUE) +\n    dnorm(p[2], -0.5, 1, log = TRUE)\n}\n\n# set.seed(5)\n# musk_hmm_data_crawl_winter &lt;- musk_hmm_data_filter %&gt;%\n#   filter(season == \"winter\", \n#          ### removing this burst as it has not been fitting well\n#          burst_id != \"7010_2008_winter_1\") %&gt;%\n#   momentuHMM::crawlWrap(Time.name = \"datetime\", \n#                         timeStep = \"8 hours\", \n#                         attempts = 100,\n#                         retryFits = 10,\n#                         theta = c(4,-0.5),\n#                         prior = prior_winter,\n#                         retrySD = 2)\n# saveRDS(musk_hmm_data_crawl_winter, \n#         here(\"data/processed/musk_hmm_data_crawl_winter.rds\"))\n# ### remove object for now as it is large\n# # rm(musk_hmm_data_crawl_winter)\n# \n# set.seed(5)\n# musk_hmm_data_crawl_summer &lt;- musk_hmm_data_filter %&gt;%\n#   filter(season == \"summer\") %&gt;%\n#   momentuHMM::crawlWrap(Time.name = \"datetime\", \n#                         timeStep = \"8 hours\", \n#                         attempts = 100,\n#                         retryFits = 10,\n#                         theta = c(6,-0.5),\n#                         prior = prior_summer,\n#                         retrySD = 2)\n# saveRDS(musk_hmm_data_crawl_summer, \n#         here(\"data/processed/musk_hmm_data_crawl_summer.rds\"))\n### remove object for now as it is large\n# rm(musk_hmm_data_crawl_summer)\n\nNow that we have filled the gaps in the bursts, we can fit HMMs. The first step will be to fit a single model to our gap-filled data. We will try to predict 2 states for each season: one for foraging and one for relocating. Previous studies have created a third state that represents resting (i.e. not moving), but the temporal resolution of our data does not allow for the fine scale movement information that would permit this identification.\nThere is the option to include random effects in these models; however, using a random effect for muskox ID did not lead to a better model fit based on AIC, so it was not included in the final model. There is also the option to include covariates that influence the probabilities of state transitions. I may try using snow depth and day of season to see if they have an infleunce, but for now we will stick with no covariates.\n\nmusk_hmm_data_crawl_summer &lt;- readRDS(here(\"data/processed/musk_hmm_data_crawl_summer.rds\"))\nmusk_hmm_data_crawl_winter &lt;- readRDS(here(\"data/processed/musk_hmm_data_crawl_winter.rds\"))\nmusk_hmm_data_formatted_winter &lt;- prepData(musk_hmm_data_crawl_winter)\nmusk_hmm_data_formatted_summer &lt;- prepData(musk_hmm_data_crawl_summer)\n\n# set.seed(5)\n# base_model_winter &lt;- fitHMM(musk_hmm_data_formatted_winter, \n#              nbStates = 2,\n#              dist = list(step = \"gamma\", angle = \"vm\"),\n#              Par0 = list(step=c(100,1000,100,1000,0.1,0.1),\n#                          angle=c(0.2,0.8)),\n#              retryFits = 10)\n# saveRDS(base_model_winter,here(\"output/hmm/base_model_winter.rds\"))\n# base_model_winter &lt;- readRDS(here(\"output/hmm/base_model_winter.rds\"))\n\n# set.seed(5)\n# base_model_summer &lt;- fitHMM(musk_hmm_data_formatted_summer, \n#              nbStates = 2,\n#              dist = list(step = \"gamma\", angle = \"vm\"),\n#              Par0 = list(step=c(100,1000,100,1000,0.1,0.1),\n#                          angle=c(0.2,0.8)),\n#              retryFits = 10)\n# saveRDS(base_model_summer,here(\"output/hmm/base_model_summer.rds\"))\nbase_model_summer &lt;- readRDS(here(\"output/hmm/base_model_summer.rds\"))\n\n### save the base model parameters to use as initial values for the multiple\n### imputation models\n# base_model_params_winter &lt;- getPar(base_model_winter)\nbase_model_params_summer &lt;- getPar(base_model_summer)\n\nThe next step is run multiple imputations of the HMM using simulated data to fill in the missing location data for each burst.
