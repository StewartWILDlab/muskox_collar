    "text": "Movement Trends\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the time series above, movement tends to be highest in the summer (June, July, August), gradually decrease during autumn (September, October, November) and winter (December, January, February) and experience a sharp increase in the late spring (May). Perhaps this increase is timed with parturition, which has been found to start in April/May (Adamczewski 1997). Alternatively, this could be tied to the timing of snowmelt. We can explore this further by looking at average seasonal step lengths for each muskox:\n\n\n\n\n\nStep lengths in the winter and spring are similar, whereas autumn step lengths are intermediate between winter and summer. This again highlights the discrepancy between the gradual decrease in step lengths from summer to winter compared with the sharper increase from winter to summer.\nFor the most part, average seasonal step lengths are consistent between muskoxen, though there appear to be greater variation in the spring and autumn. To examine this further, let’s plot smoothed curves of step lengths against day of year for different years. We’ll restrict this plot to muskoxen-year combinations with more than half a year’s worth of data:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe curves of step lengths follow similar trajectories but there is still considerable variation across years and among muskoxen. This suggests weather, landscape, and muskox characteristics may play a part in influencing movement behaviour.\nMovement behaviour in spring may be related to calving. Previous studies in Greenland have shown that muskoxen benefit from earlier spring green-up (Eikelenboom et al., 2021), so muskoxen may be able to alter their movement behaviour depending on green-up timing. In 2008 and 2009, surveys were flown to relocate collared muskoxen to see if they were accompanied by calves. We can plot these data on graphs of step lengths in the spring to investigate how approximate calving dates impact movement.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing the graphs of muskoxen that were observed to be accompanied by a calf to those that were not, there does not appear to be a major difference in the general trend for step lengths. 7013 in 2009 is the only trajectory to show a sudden decrease in step lengths that resembles those used to determine calving dates for caribou (Bonar et al., 2018; DeMars et al., 2013), but this signal is not present for any of the other muskoxen. For most muskoxen, there is a marked increase in step length in mid-May, but this does not appear to be related to calving dates. The survey data shows that in almost all spring surveys (April onwards), the collared muskoxen were in groups consisting of other females with calves. Only 7010 in 2009 was in a group that wasn’t observed to contain calves until the June survey. I am not sure if these observations"

    "text": "Net Squared Displacement\nWe can also look at net squared displacement curves to investigate movement patterns of muskoxen (i.e. resident, migratory, or nomadic). See Bunnefeld et al. (2011) for examples of how these curves look for different movement classes (i.e. migrant, disperser, resident, nomad).\nTo do this we will use the adehabitatLT package to format our data and the migrateR package to fit different models to the net displacement data. Let’s first get our collar data into the trajectory format used by adehabitatLT. We will also subset our data to one observation per day to improve modelling efficiency.\n\nmusk_collar_sub &lt;- musk_collar_filt %&gt;%\n  filter(lubridate::hour(datetime) == 16)\n\nxy &lt;- musk_collar_sub %&gt;%\n  sf::st_transform(\"+proj=utm +zone=9\") %&gt;%\n  sf::st_coordinates()\nltraj &lt;- adehabitatLT::as.ltraj(xy = xy, date = musk_collar_sub$datetime, id = musk_collar_sub$Id_Number)\n\nadehabitatLT::ld(ltraj) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = R2n)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.5) +\n  geom_line() +\n  ylab(\"Net squared displacement (km^2)\") +\n  facet_wrap(~id, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows the net squared displacement from the initial location for each collared muskoxen. There does not appear to be a clear movement behaviour shared between all muskoxen. Most appear to have short periods of time during the summer with large net squared displacement, but these are generally followed by longer periods where net squared displacement is much smaller. Muskoxen 7011 and 7012 show a general increasing trend in net squared displacement, but there are still extended periods of smaller displacement throughout the time series. Most of the periods of larger displacement do not appear to be long enough to represent a separate summer range. Examinations of animations of muskox movements generally show that they tend to move between patches of resources during the summer rather than sticking to one specific area."

Let’s start by looking at histograms of step lengths:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stepped nature of the distances traveled on the left side of the graph are a result of the resolution of the GPS device. For collars 707, 709, and 710, there appear to be a greater-than-expected number of instances where the muskoxen move negligible distances. By plotting time series of step lengths, we can can see that these negligible distances occur at the end of the recording periods:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor simplicity, let’s remove all points following the first two consecutive short step lengths (i.e. 0 or 4.4747041) at the end of the time series.\n\n\n\n\n\nId_Number\nDaysRemoved\n\n\n\n\n707\n108\n\n\n709\n36\n\n\n710\n19"

    "text": "Data Filtering\nNow that we have removed data that we know contain errors, we can start to look for less obvious sources of errors. The SDLfilter package has two functions, dupfilter and ddfilter, that remove data duplicates and unlikely points, respectively.\nFirst let’s use dupfilter to remove duplicate data points with the same date and time.\n\nsdl_dup &lt;- SDLfilter::dupfilter(sdl_musk, \n                                step.time = 7,\n                                conditional = TRUE)\n\n\ndupfilter_exact removed 3 of 14065 locations\ndupfilter_qi removed 0 of 14062 locations\ndupfilter_time removed 31 of 14062 locations\ndupfilter_space removed 0 of 14031 locations\n\nInput data: 14065 locations\nFiltered data: 14031 locations\ndupfilter removed 34 locations (0.24% of original data)\n\n\nNext we’ll use ddfilter to filter points based on speed and turning angles between consecutive points. To use this function, we need to estimate the maximum reasonable speed between two consecutive locations. The vmax function maps a gamma distribution to the observed speeds and estimates the maximum speed as the value with a cumulative probability of 0.999.\n\nvmax &lt;- SDLfilter::vmax(sdl_dup, prob = 0.999)\n\n\ndupfilter_exact removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_qi removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_time removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_space removed 176 of 14031 locations\n\nInput data: 14031 locations\nFiltered data: 13855 locations\ndupfilter removed 176 locations (1.25% of original data)\n\n\nThe maximum linear speed (Vmax) was estimated using 13841 locations.\nVmax: 0.4891431 km/h\n\n\nWe will also estimate the maximum one-way linear speed of a loop trip. A loop trip is defined as a spatial departure and return involving a series of three or more consecutive points. The vmaxlp function also uses a gamma distribution to estimate this speed:\n\nvmaxlp &lt;- SDLfilter::vmaxlp(sdl_dup, prob = 0.999)\n\n\ndupfilter_exact removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_qi removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_time removed 0 of 14031 locations\ndupfilter_space removed 176 of 14031 locations\n\nInput data: 14031 locations\nFiltered data: 13855 locations\ndupfilter removed 176 locations (1.25% of original data)\n\n\nThe maximum one-way linear speed of a loop trip (vmaxlp) was estimated using \n180 Vlp from 90 loop trips.\nvmaxlp: 0.269 km/h\n\n\nNow we can filter our data using ddfilter. Locations are removed if one of following criteria are met: 1) speed from previous and to subsequent location both exceed vmax; 2) inner angle is less than a given threshold and speed from a previous or to a subsequent location exceeds vmaxlp. We will specify a turning angle of 14 degrees, as outlined in Bjørneraas et al. 2010.\n\nsdl_dd1 &lt;- SDLfilter::ddfilter(sdl_dup, qi = 5, \n                              vmax = vmax, vmaxlp = vmaxlp,\n                              ia = 14)\n\n\nddfilter_speed removed 39 of 14031 locations\nddfilter_loop removed 38 of 13992 locations\n\nInput data: 14031 locations\nFiltered data: 13954 locations\nddfilter removed 77 locations (0.55% of original data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe filtered points appear non-randomly across the time series, which suggests that our speed thresholds were too small. Let’s increase vmax and vmaxlp to more conservative values of 2 km/h and 1 km/h, respectively.\n\nsdl_dd2 &lt;- SDLfilter::ddfilter(sdl_dup, qi = 5, \n                              vmax = 2, vmaxlp = 1,\n                              ia = 14)\n\n\nddfilter_speed removed 1 of 14031 locations\nddfilter_loop removed 1 of 14030 locations\n\nInput data: 14031 locations\nFiltered data: 14029 locations\nddfilter removed 2 locations (0.01% of original data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat seems to do a better job of only removing the most extreme points."
